This bot is meant to help identify issues with a CPython pull request.

## What the bot does:
- ### Identifies missing bugs.python.org issue numbers in the title
If no b.p.o issue number is found the status fails and the
"Details" link points to the relevant
[section of the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/pullrequest/#submitting).
- ### Links to bugs.python.org
If an issue number is found then the "Details" link points to the relevant issue 
itself, making it easier to navigate from PR to issue.
- ### Identifies missing news entry
If no `Misc/NEWS.d` entry is found or the news entry is formatted incorrectly 
and the issue doesn't have the `skip news` label, the status fails and a relevant 
description label is added to it.
- ### Closes invalid PRs
Closes PRs that try to merge a maintenance branch into the master branch, adds 
`invalid` label, and posts a relevant message.
- ### Labels PRs for docs
Labels PRs for documentation as `type-documentation`
- ### Copies master labels to backport
Copies labels from master PRs to backport PRs

## *Aside*: where does the name come from?
Since this bot is about identifying pull requests that need changes,
it seemed fitting to name it after Sir Bedevere who knew
[how to identify a witch](https://youtu.be/yp_l5ntikaU).
