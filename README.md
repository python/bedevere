This bot is meant to help identify issues with a CPython pull request.

## What the bot identifies
### bugs.python.org issue numbers in the title
If no b.p.o issue number is found the status fails and the
"Details" link points to the relevant
[section of the devguide](https://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/pullrequest.html?highlight=bpo-#submitting).
If an issue number is found then the "Details" link points to the
issue itself, making it easier to navigate from PR to issue.

## *Aside*: where does the name come from?
Since this bot is about identifying pull requests that need changes,
it seemed fitting to name it after Sir Bedevere who knew
[how to identify a witch](https://youtu.be/k3jt5ibfRzw).
